  abstract = {MoS2 nanoflakes have attracted wide attention due to their outstanding catalytic activity induced by their active zigzag edges. Nanoflakes morphologies dictate their electronic properties, and factors such as size, doping, and interaction with a substrate determines their behavior. Herein, we investigate the role of the Au(111) substrate in the morphology of Mo10S24 nanoflakes via first-principles density functional theory calculations combined with the k-means clustering algorithm for structure selection. From our initial calculations for gas-phase nanoflakes, we found that asymmetric morphologies are about 2.7eV lower in energy than the symmetric ones. Thus, we deposited a few nanoflakes on the Au(111) substrate to investigate their effects. Here, we obtain a strong nanoflake/gold interaction ruled by features such as symmetry, roughness, and vertical S–Au stacking. The S–Au interaction is large enough to change the relative energies between the nanoflakes in the gas-phase by more than 2.0eV, which indicates the relevance of substrate engineering for the nanoflake morphology.},

  abstract = {MoS2 is a key two-dimensional material with a broad range of potential technological applications, which includes flexible nanoelectronics, sensors, support for catalysts, photovoltaics, etc. During device operation, the interactions of gas molecules with the MoS2 surface can significantly affect its performance. In this study, we report a theoretical study based on density functional theory of the impact of sulfur vacancies, a common point defect in MoS2 monolayers, on the adsorption properties of 12 relevant molecules on MoS2 monolayers. Our findings reveal that H2O, N2, CO, O2, NO, and SO2 exhibit the lowest interaction energies when adsorbed in proximity to sulfur vacancies, leading to a modification in their adsorption orientation compared to the pristine surface of MoS2. In contrast, the remaining investigated molecules (H2, NH3, CH4, N2O, CO2, and NO2) preferentially adsorb on pristine regions of MoS2. We attribute these results to differences in charge transfer between the molecules and the surface, with sulfur vacancies inducing more significant charge transfer for the first set of molecules. Notably, the adsorption of NO stands out from the others as it leads to an increase in the work function of MoS2 by 1.25eV due to the creation of energy levels within the MoS2 band gap. Additionally, NO passivates sulfur vacancies through covalent bonds. Among the remaining 11 molecules, only NO2 and SO2 induce modifications in the electronic structure around the MoS2 bandgap region, showcasing the potential of MoS2 for sensing these molecules, whereas sulfur vacancies enhance only the SO2/monolayer interaction energy, suggesting a promising avenue for selective sensing.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor materials offer a platform for unconventional applications such as valleytronics, flexible nanoelectronics, and hosts of quantum emitters. Many of these materials and their electronic properties remain to be explored. Using ab initio simulations based on the density functional theory, we investigate group-IV monochalcogenides MQ (M=Si, Ge, Sn and Q=S, Se, Te), an emerging class of 2D materials, with two competing crystal structures: (i) phosphorenelike (Pmn21), which has already been synthesized, and (ii) SiTe-type (P{\textasciimacron}3m1), which has been much less explored. Except for SnS, we find that the SiTe type is the lowest-energy structure and has higher structural stability, motivating efforts to synthesize this less explored P{\textasciimacron}3m1 phase. Regarding the optoelectronic properties of these two phases, in the P{\textasciimacron}3m1 phase, MQ compounds have band gaps around the sunlight spectrum peak and show narrower variations in band gap with the composition and higher absorption coefficients for lighter chalcogens. In contrast, in the Pmn21 phase, MQ compounds have wider band gaps and show a band gap variation of up to 72\% with composition, higher absorption coefficients with Te atoms, and potential for valleytronics. In particular, SiS shows interesting high optical anisotropy among all the investigated materials. Furthermore, the optical spectra present peaks that are particular to each phase or composition, making the refractive index a distinguishing parameter for identifying the different MQ compounds. Finally, a phase transition from monolayer to bulk due to an interaction between the layers is observed. Thus, the present results straighten out the role of the crystalline phase in the optoelectronic properties of these monochalcogenides.},

  abstract = {Perovskite-based materials ({$A$}⁢{$B$}⁢{$X$}3) show promise for photovoltaic applications; however, commercial use still encounters challenges, specifically Pb toxicity and structural instabilities of the active phases. A potential lead-free compound is CsSnI3; nonetheless, the photoinactive yellow phase is energetically more favorable than the photoactive black phase. An undesired black {$\rightarrow$}yellow phase transition implies structural instabilities, possibly explained by the Goldschmidt tolerance factor of 0.84. In this study, we employ theoretical calculations to investigate the impact of substitutional bivalent doping in the {$B$} sites of CsSnI3 with 3⁢{$d$} transition metals ({$T$}⁢{$M$}) on tuning the relative energetic stability between the black and yellow phases. Our calculations are based on density functional theory, incorporating on-site Hubbard corrections for the {$T$}⁢{$M$} 3⁢{$d$} states. We observe an inversion of the relative stability between the yellow and black phases for dopings with Co, Cu, and Zn. We attribute the interphase relative energy to Jahn-Teller distortions at the doped octahedra, as the black and yellow phases exhibit distinct octahedral interconnections. For instance, the black phase has corner-shared octahedra, resulting in lower elastic costs for accommodating geometric distortions compared to the edge-shared octahedra in the yellow phase. The presented results highlight the influence of symmetry breaks on the stability of perovskite materials and have implications for other perovskite compositions.},
